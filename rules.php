PLEASE READ BEFORE JOINING SAVEFATE
<br>
Thank you for your interest in Save Fate!
<br>
Save Fate is a text-based MMORPG. 
<br>
The following Game Rules, violations of the rules and the punishments for breaking those rules, should be read before you sign up to play the game.
<br>
<br>
Multiple Accounts:
<br>
Only one account is allowed per player. It is against game rules to create multiple accounts to better your main character. If you have more than one account, that is termed as a ‘multi’ account. If you do have more than one account, your main character will be placed in jail, and your multis will be deleted. Any gains made through the multi account(s) will be removed from the main character. If the offender continues to make more accounts after the main account has been jailed, the new accounts will also be terminated and there is a possibility of being banned from the game completely.
<br>
If more than one person plays from the same IP, i.e., you play from school or you have relatives that play from your home, this is allowed but you will be asked to provide proof that these accounts are not multis of one player. There will be no transactions allowed between any of the accounts played under the same IP.
<br>
<br>
Flooding:
<br>
The intentional spamming or flooding of the forums, chat rooms, or other communication venues will result in 1.) A fine or ban for lesser violations, or 2.) In extreme cases the account will be placed in jail for a minimum of 5-days.
<br>
<br>
Player harassment:
<br>
Player harassment is a difficult area for anyone on the Internet to keep under wraps, as all people have different levels of acceptance. The Admins and/or staff of Save Fate will determine whether or not a particular situation is to be deemed as harassment. Please note: If you contact a staff member in regards to harassment by another player, be prepared to show proof of the harassment. Staff will not accept complaints made that say, “ So and so called me a bad word!! Put him in jail!!” Without proof of the actual harassment, a copy of the mail sent, etc. there isn’t much staff can do to help you.
<br>
The occasional insult from another player will not be considered as harassment, unless that insult contains excessive profanity, sexually explicit language, or racial slurs. In that situation, a warning will be sent, and if the player the warning was sent to continues to harass the other player or players involved, then the offender will be given a jail term suitable to the infraction.
<br>
Public harassment will not be allowed. If you have a gripe with a fellow player, please take it to a private venue. If the persons involved cannot straighten out the situation privately, then contact an admin or game staff to help mediate the situation. There is no reason for public harassment of a fellow player or players, and if you do so, it will result in a 10-day jail term.
<br>
<br>
Staff harassment/slander (public locations):
<br>
Any complaints made against staff will be presented in a clear, courteous manner, bereft of profanity. Slanderous/personal attacks/profane communications against staff members on public forums will not be tolerated, and will result in the offending remarks removed, and a 10-day jail sentence for the offender.
<br>
<br>
Scripts/Continual Connections:
<br>
Programs designed to automate actions or continually collect information on the game are not permitted. Any piece of software; be it a custom-made "script" or a simple "refresher" that continually targets a section of the game without human interaction or regard to the content displayed is forbidden. In short, every click sent to the game servers must come from a live person, not an automated system. Anyone found using such a system will be jailed for minimum of 60-days, and any game assets suspected of coming from the use of the script will be removed.
<br>
<br>
Unauthorized access of another account/account sharing/ownership:
<br>
You cannot share an account with another person. You may NOT "baby-sit" someone's account, and you may not use another person's account as your own for a prolonged period of time. This rule is primarily in place to deal with situations where two people claim ownership over a single account.
<br>
<br>
Game bug abuse:
<br>
Depending on the severity, game bug abuse will result in anywhere from a 30-day jail term to the possibility of the offending account being deleted. Bugs, loopholes, security flaws, or any inconsistencies in the game should be immediately reported on the forums in the bugs and errors board. If the bug is something that can be construed as a game exploit, it should be reported directly to a game Owner, or an Admin, and not posted on the forums.
<br>
<br>
Community Failure:
<br>
Any activity that undermines the game community, presents a general nuisance to the community, or breaks the spirit of any game law is forbidden. There is no set punishment for these actions, and it is up to the discretion of game staff to determine the penalty, dependent on the severity of the infraction.
<br>
<br>
Responsibility:
<br>
The account owner is responsible for their account at all times. This means if your friends, family members, or your dog logs into your account and causes trouble, you will be held responsible. Keep your username and password secure.
<br>
<br>
Repeat offenders:
<br>
Harsher punishments/deletions may occur for repeat offenders.
<br>
<br>
Loss of items due to unauthorized access "hacking":
<br>
Lost items will only be returned to players or clans, provided the items are traceable.
<br>
<br>
Bad trades "ripping" guild staff selling:
<br>
Unless the failure is a result of a confirmed programming error, items lost by players to bad trades will not always be returned. Buyers beware.
<br>
<br>
Lost accounts due to unauthorized access "hacking":
<br>
Accounts will be returned to the proper owner provided they are able to confirm their identity and ownership of the account in question. No refund of game items or money will occur. Players who continually "lose" their account will stop having it returned.
<br>
<br>
Player placed images:
<br>
Images containing nudity follow the US laws on public nudity. Topless males are allowed while topless females are not. Bottomless nudity is never allowed. Nudity laws do not apply to works of art, subject to general consensus on what is art. In general there are little restrictions on image content, provided that offensive images are not placed where people who don't want to see them don't have to (i.e. Signatures).
<br>
<br>
Player-Staff interaction:
<br>
Both players and staff are expected to coexist in a polite and respectful environment. This applies to both professional situations and instances where staff is acting in the capacity of a player, and not an administrator. Do remember that the staff are volunteers, and have the same right to enjoy and play the game in the same capacity as any regular member of SF. In other words, if a staff member is battling you, that’s all it is, playing the game, and not meant as a personal attack on yourself.
<br>
<br>
Staff obligations to players:
<br>
Staff are obligated to respond, and assist to the best of their ability, in any requests or complaints made known to them. All requests or complaints must be termed in an appropriate fashion, any request, or complaints that use the excessive use of profanity will be ignored, or dealt with in a manner which best befits the situation. You may contact staff in game by mailing them, at this time, that is the only avenue to report complaints or other issues between players. There may be other venues implemented in the future, and when/if those functions are implemented; all players will be notified of the changes through game news.
<br>
If there is any failure to pay, or attempt to chargeback or withhold payment of purchased items, regardless of cause or alleged excuse, User acknowledges that SF is entitled to collect from User any and all attorneys’ fees and any other costs incurred by SF, directly or indirectly, because of such default, including, without limitation, all such fees and costs incurred in post judgment proceedings, such as collection proceedings and appeals.
<br>
SF expressly disclaims any and all warranties of any kind, including, without limitation, warranties of merchantability and fitness for particular purpose.
<br>
SF will not be liable for any consequential or incidental damages of any kind, including, without limitation, emotional distress, suicide, or emotional or psychological injury of any kind, and any damages allegedly incurred because of defamation by any party, whether a user of SF or otherwise.
<br>
